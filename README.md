# QuestionsApp [WIP]

This app intends to be a question collaborative platform using HTML blockchain as reward for the best questions formulated by teachers. This platform is intended to be used by engineers and programmers for training their skills. The aim is delivery courses with questions formulated dynamical based in functions. 

The Blockchain automatically delivers a certificate if a student concludes a set of best questions for a determined theme in a determined time. 

## The platform is profitable using:

* Web browsing mining
* Payable Student Certificates

## The platform will reward:

* The best questions and resolutions reviewed by teachers of the same theme 
* The teachers which formulated the question

## As features:

* Dynamic questions: example
Theme: Mathematics

Question:The sum of $field:a;random(0,10)$ more $field:b; random(0,10)$ is:

a) function(fields){return field.a+field.b}

b) random(21,30)

c) function(){return random(0,10)+random(0,5)} 

Explanation: It is defined fields a and b with random values in the question, the answer is given by a function which computes a + b 

* Latex usage in questions

* Teacher can formulate a course and use the extensive database questions about the theme. 

## Similar platforms

[Steem](https://steemit.com/) --> Uses blockchain as reward for content
[Qconcursos](https://www.qconcursos.com/) --> Platform with questions and resolutions but without blockchain reward

## TODO

* Create token for the platform
* Define best tecnology to do the job
* Roadmap
